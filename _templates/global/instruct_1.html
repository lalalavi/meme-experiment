<p>In the study, you can post “Memes” (humorous pictures) and rate Memes posted by the other Users. You rate the Memes posted by other Users by giving a “Like” if you enjoy someone’s post. If you do not enjoy it, you can just wait for another User's post. In turn, other Users can Like your posts.</p>
<br>

<p>You can post Memes whenever you want. Each time you decide to post a Meme, you select among a set of potentially funny, interesting or relatable Meme pictures. Please select the Meme you like the best and that you think the others will like as well.</p>
