<p>You will make a series of about 150-200 choices; you will have rest breaks throughout. </p>

<p>On each choice, you will see two Decider face avatars on the screen. You can choose whom to play with using the LEFT arrow key and the RIGHT arrow key on the keyboard.</p>
 
<br/> 
<p>The positions of the player's avatars on the screen will sometimes change. This means you need to choose LEFT or RIGHT based on where the person you want to choose is located. </p>

        <p> You will have two seconds to choose on each round of the game.</p>
