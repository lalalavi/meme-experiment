<p>You can post Memes whenever you want. Each time you decide to post a Meme, you select among a set of six potentially funny, interesting or relatable Meme pictures. 
    Please select the Meme you like the best and that you think the others will like as well.</p>
<br>
<p>
    After you have selected a Meme, you are asked to add three informative "tags" (short keywords) related to this Meme. These tags will be used in a future study.
    It is therefore important that your tags are as clear and descriptive as possible. 
    However, this is not required to post an image. You are free to do this step as you would be in real social media.</p>
