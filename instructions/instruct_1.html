<p>After you have selected a Meme, you are asked to add three informative "tags" (short keywords) related to this Meme. 
    These tags might be used for the data analysis of the study. It is therefore important that your tags are as clear and descriptive as possible.
    However, this is not required to post an image. <b>You are free to do this step</b> as you would be in real social media.</p>

<p>After you have selected the tags, your post is ready and you will see the real feedback associated with the image.
You will then be asked to report your emotional status. Please note you are <b>required to report your status</b> in order to continue.</p>
<br>
<b>Summary:</b>
<p>You can post Memes as often as you want and/or see and rate the Memes in the feed, for the whole duration of the experiment.
Feel free to try out the different possibilities.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Before we proceed with the experiment, you will be asked a few questions about the instructions in order to see if you understood them correctly.</b></p>
