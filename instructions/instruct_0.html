<p>In this study, you will be interacting within a platform that is meant to resemble aspects of social media (for example, Instagram).
You can either <b>post</b> “Memes” (humorous pictures) or <b>see and rate</b>  Memes in the Feed. </p>

<p>This is a preview of how the platform will look like: </p>
<div class="centered">
    <img style='height: 100%; width: 80%; object-fit: contain' src="{% static 'global/Instructions.png' %}">
</div>

<p>You can post Memes whenever you want by pressing the "POST" button. Each time you decide to post a Meme, <b>you select among a set of six potentially funny, interesting or relatable Meme pictures</b>. 
Please select the Meme you like the best and that you think the others will like as well. You select a meme by <b>PRESSING A NUMBER IN YOUR KEYBOARD</b>.
<br>
<p>In an earlier part of this study, these memes were rated by 40 independent participants.
Thus, the feedback you will receive after you post is <strong>real</strong>. 
The maximum number of Likes that a post received during the ratings was 34, and the minimum was 13.</p>
